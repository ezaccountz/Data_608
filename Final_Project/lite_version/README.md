Lite Version: In order to upload the program to Heroku, this lite version is created. In this lite version, the raw data from <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95"> NYC Open Data - Motor Vehicle Collisions - Crashes </a>
is pre-processed and cleaned and stored in csv files. When the program runs, data is loaded directly from the csv files to reduce the memory used for data processing. The data is updated on 12/11/2021, any data after is not included.<br>
<br>
The link for the deployed app is <a href="https://nyc-vehicle-collisions-lite.herokuapp.com/"> NYC Vehicle Collisions Lite </a>
